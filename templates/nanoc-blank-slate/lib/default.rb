# All files in the 'lib' directory will be loaded
# before nanoc starts compiling.




# To use this helper, activate the Rendering helper
# (see the helpers section for details),
# which is done by adding this line of code to some file in
# the lib directory (I recommend lib/helpers.rb):
# USE EXAMPLE:
# <%= render 'head' %>     --OR--
# <%= render "head", :title => "Foo" %>

# To access uncomment:
# include Nanoc::Helpers::Rendering
